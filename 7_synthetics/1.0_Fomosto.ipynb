You can click on https://greens-mill.pyrocko.org and explore the different spatial scales and sampling rates available. When you find a suitable store, you can simply check the ID and download it with:\n",

    "Fomosto is a unified interface that allows the Green's function computation and makes it simpler to build, but the actual numerical computation is done with an additional modelling code. \n",

    "*QSSP* calculate synthetic seismograms based on a layered, self-gravitating spherical Earth using the normal mode theory. You can choose this backend when you need global seismograms at very low (first eigenmodes) or very high frequencies (4 Hz has been tested), when you deal with core phases or if you are interested in the coupling of earth and atmosphere.\n",

    "*QSEIS* code calculate synthetic seismograms based on a layered viscoelastic half-space model. You can choose this backend when you are using local and regional configurations, when you need to consider different source/receiver structures, and also to compute single force excitation Green's functions.\n",

    "*PSGRN-PSCMP* is used to calculate synthetics stress/strain/tilt/gravitational fields based on a layered viscoelastic half-space. If you need to calculate synthetic static and/or viscoelastic displacement fields of tectonic events, magmatic intrusions or fluid migrations, then this backend is the best choice. Also useful for the synthetics calculation of many points like InSAR or GPS.\n",
