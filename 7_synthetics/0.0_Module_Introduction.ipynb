    "\n",
    "A very important topic in seismology is the synthetic seismogram calculation. This task requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a **source model**, which refers to the excitacion source\n",
    "* a **Green's function store**, which correspond to the media response at a receiver to a simple excitation at the source, i.e., a Green's function describes the seismic wave propagation from the source to the receiver, and\n",
    "* the **target configuration**, i.e., the receivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image from [Heimann et al., 2019](https://se.copernicus.org/articles/10/1921/2019/) shows the three concepts previously described, where a GF store contains the media response of a certain source at a certain receiver.\n",

    "![](gf_pyrocko.png) \n",
    "In this module we will cover the different source types, how to calculate Green's functions and how to download pre-calculated stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn about the tool **Fomosto**, which allows to create, inspect and manipulate Green's function stores. We will also go through how to create synthetics from a point source and how to check the source radiation effects.  \n",
