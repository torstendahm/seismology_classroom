The next step, depending on your purpose, is selection of stations that may have recorded the event. The last step is requesting and downloading the corresponding waveform data. After that,  you are ready for processing, analysis etc. \n",

Usually national services provide those information but also international ones. Of importance is, that not every service/agency lists or records all events. Often, different agencies provide (little) different solutions for the same event.\n",
