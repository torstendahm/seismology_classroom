    "- **Object**: Everything in Python is an *object*! An object has `properties` and `methods`.\n",
    "- **Properties**: Properties store data associated with an object. Properties can be accessed by `object.property`.\n",
    "- **Classes**: Classes are the construction plans for *Object*s. A class defines\n",
    "    - how to construct an object (e.g. how to build a car)\n",
    "    - which properties it has and (e.g. it has a color and it has a number of wheels)\n",
    "    - which methods are bound to it. (e.g. it can steer left and right and honk)  \n",
    "- **Instance**: The process of using a class is called *instantiation*, because you create a specific *Instance* of that *Class*.\n",
    "    - A class can accept *arguments* at construction time to set some of its *properties* (e.g. a blue car with 8 wheels)\n",
    "    - An object is *instantiated* from a class by `Class(argument, argument, ...)`\n",
    "- **Argument**: This is how the values passed to a function, method or class are called.\n",
    "- **Functions**: A function is not part of an object an can be executed by `function(argument, argument, ...)`. A function can\n",
    "    - compute something,\n",
    "    - return a result.\n",
    "- **Methods**: Methods are similar to functions, but are part of (bound to) an object. Methods can be executed by `object.method(argument, argument, ...)`. A method can\n",
    "    - compute something,\n",
    "    - access and change the state (properties) of the object it is bound to, (e.g. change the door state of a car from open to closed)\n",
    "    - return a result (e.g. the current fuel level of the car)\n",
    "- **Method vs Function**:\n",
    "    - A **Method** is bound to an object and can have side-effects (change state).\n",
    "    - A **Function** is not bound to an object and has no side-effects.\n",
    "    - **Side-Effects**: When an operation changes an objects state or global state it has side-effects.\n",
    "- **Indentation**:\n",
    "    - This is specific to Python and is used to tell `Python` which parts of code belong together\n",
    "    - This is done by using spaces or tabs.\n",
