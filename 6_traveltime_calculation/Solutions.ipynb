    "### Phase definitions\n",
    "First we need to find the phase definitions for the different P phases from the IASPEI webpage. This will give:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Long definition|Phasename|\n",
    "|:-|:-|\n",
    "|the P wave refracted at the core-mantle boundary | **Pdiff** |\n",
    "|the P wave traveling through the outer core | **PKP** |\n",
    "|the P wave traveling through outer and inner core | **PKIKP** |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance range\n",
    "When checking the travel time curves, we can find a good distance range from 115 - 145 degrees. In this distance range all of the mentioned phases should be observed, as shown here:\n",

    "### Plot of ray paths\n",
    "\n",
    "The <a href='https://pyrocko.org/docs/current/apps/cake/manual.html'>cake manual</a> suggests to use `plot-rays`. We want to plot rays for the three different phases **Pdiff, PKP, PKIKP**, which we can define using the `classic` keyword argument: `--classic=Pdiff,PKP,PKIKP`. The distance range is given in degrees between 115 and 145 degrees with an increment of 5 degrees: `--distances=115:145:5 --degrees`. Finally the input model needs to be defined, which is done using `--model=prem-no-ocean.m`\n",
    "\n",
    "So the full command to plot the ray paths will be\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cake plot-rays --classic=Pdiff,PKP,PKIKP --distances=115:145:5 --degrees --model=prem-no-ocean.m\n",

    "### Arrival time extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrival times are extracted from the ground models using cakes `arrivals` command. Other keyword arguments are the same as for the ray plot. Furthermore we need to define the source depth as 30 km: `--sdepth=30`\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrival times e.g. at 135 degrees distance are then computed using the following full command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cake arrivals --classic=Pdiff,PKP,PKIKP --distances=135 --degrees --sdepth=30 --model=prem-no-ocean.m`\n",

    "## Task 3: Cake phases\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the task refers to the reason for so many different P and S-wave arrivals. When printing detailed phase information (done by inserting `print(phase)` into the marker and arrival calculation loop), we get more information on each wave e.g. description for phase `P_24.4p` is:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "Phase definition \"P_24.4p\" (entered as \"P\"):\n",
    " - P mode propagation, departing downward\n",
    " - propagation as headwave at interface in 24.4 km depth\n",
    " - P mode propagation, departing upward\n",
    " - arriving at target from below\n",
    " ```\n",
    "indicating a primarly downwards propagation of the P-wave. It gets refracted then at a layer boundary in 24.4 km depth. From there it departs upwards and hits the target from below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each P and S-wave phase arriving has taken a different travel path through different number of layers beeing refracted or reflected at shallow layer boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless wave energy is not split evenly between the different phases, but certain P and S-wave phases contain more energy compared to others. You can find out, which, when importing both the data and the cake arrivals into Snuffler as shown below"
