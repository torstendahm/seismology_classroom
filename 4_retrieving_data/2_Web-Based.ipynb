The next step, depending on your purpose, is the selection of stations that may have recorded the event. The last step includes requesting and downloading of the corresponding waveform data. After that, you are ready for processing, analysis etc. \n",

    "There are several sites that provide information about events that have occured. Often they provide additional information like source mechanisms, if available. Usually national services provide those information but also international ones. Of importance is, that not every service/agency lists or records all events. Often, different agencies provide (little) different solutions for the same event.\n",
