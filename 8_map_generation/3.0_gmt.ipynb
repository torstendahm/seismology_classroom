    "GMT is one of the commonly used scripting based map plotting packages in geophysics and also other disciplines. GMT itself has to be scripted in `bash`. Nevertheless also GMT wrappers for Python, Julia and Matlab were released through the last years.\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of largest challenges of GMT is its installation. In our case we are going to use GMT version 6.4, for which its python wrapping `pyGMT` is available.\n",

    "    PyGMT is just one wrapper. There are others, which aid you in using GMT within Python as e.g. Automap and GMTPY (modules within Pyrocko).
