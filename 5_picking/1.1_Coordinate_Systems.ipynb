    "Seismic waves are recorded using seismometers. Besides special sensors (e.g. rotational seismometers) seismometers record the unidirectional ground motion in the 3 dimensions. Each indivdual record in one dimension is called a **channel** or **component** of the seismometer. Each individual channel is clearly defined by its name. Below an example for a 3D record is shown from the 2020 M<sub>w</sub> 7.0 Samos earthquake:\n",

    "Besides the mentioned **ZNE** coordinate system other component orientations are used in the analysis of seismograms. They allow for a better assessment of different phases of the seismic wave, as they seperate different phases onto the different components (in theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because the phases (as shown in [1.0 - Introduction to Picking](1.0_introduction.ipynb)) are characterized by rather different waveform excitations. P-waves, for example, show compressional and dilatational motion in direction of waveform propagation, while S-waves are characterized by shearing perpendicular to the travel path of the waves.\n",
