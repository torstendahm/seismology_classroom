    "# Solutions for tasks in notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following solutions are given, which give brief answers to the tasks within the notebooks. Solutions for Task 1 and 2 are rather short, so still discuss with your mates, why we have proposed these solutions (and if others could be better suited?)!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1 -  Which coordinate systems and component would you prefer to use to analyse P, SH or Rayleigh waves?\n",
    "\n",
    "* P waves - LQT system using the L component\n",
    "* SH waves - LQT or ZRT system using the T component\n",
    "* Rayleigh waves - ZRT system using the Z and R components\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2 -  Which component would you prefer to use to analyse P, SH or Rayleigh waves if just ZNE records are available?\n",
    "\n",
    "* P waves - Z component (especially for distant and/or deep earthquakes)\n",
    "* SH waves - N or E component (depending on back azimuth from station to source)\n",
    "* Rayleigh waves - Z and either N or E component (depending on back azimuth from station to source)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 3 - Filter effects and their cause\n",
    "\n",
    "Both filtered traces show small undulations before and after the major signal, which are artefacts from filtering of a discrete finite-length time series. Furthermore it appears, that the signal is shifted to later times when using `lfilter`, while the pulse stays at the original time when using `filtfilt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is caused by the (a)causality of the filters. **Causal** filters, as `lfilter` move forward-in-time. The filtered value at any time is hence depending only on past and present input. Consequently **acausal** filters need both past, present and future input to compute the filtered value at any time. Acausal filters as `filtfilt` are zero-phase filter. They do not change the phase of the filtered signal. Thereby time shifts as caused by causal filters are diminished.\n",
