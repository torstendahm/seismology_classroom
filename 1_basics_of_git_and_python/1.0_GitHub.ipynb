    "# Version Control, Git & GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version control** is a system that helps a developer team to efficiently manage source codes. It allows to keep track of your work making it easy to go through changes made, who did the changes and comparing changes over time. This features make version control ideal for collaborative development. An special feature of version control is that you can also go back to previous versions of your work, so in case of any mistake, the work is not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hear about version control it is common that those refer to Git and GitHub. This notebook will go through the main points of Git and GitHub as they are not the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to understand the basic workflow of a version control and you will create your own GitHub project.\n",

    "## Git\n",
    "Git is a command line tool to track and save changes in a directory. It is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): run `sudo apt-get install git-all`\n",
    "* Linux (Fedora): run `sudo dnf install git-all`\n",
    "\n",
    "*For more details and other systems indications (Windows, Mac) please check https://github.com/git-guides/install-git.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "[GitHub](https://www.github.com) is an internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. If you create an account in GitHub you are able to upload your codes and repositories and share them with others, but if you don't create an account you are still able to access public repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "* Git is tool to track changes\n",
    "* GitHub is a cloud storage provider for Git projects, there are others but we will check this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image shows the basic workflow of Git and GitHub. We have a local and a remote area and different commands to performs certain actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M_fHUEqA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/128hsgntnsu9bww0y8sz.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "A repository is the collection of all files and the history of them (commits). It is stored in the local or remote area (the local repository is stored on your machine while the remote repository is stored online, in this case, on GitHub).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commands on an existing GitHub project\n",
    "\n",
    "**`git clone`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first thing to do when we want to work on an existing project. Cloning is simply copying the repository from a remote server to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`git pull origin master`**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have cloned the repository it is immportant to pull it, which means, downloading every commit that we do not have on our machine. This way we make sure to have an updated version of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`git checkout -b new_branch_name`**\n",
    "\n",
    "With this command you create a new branch. A branch is a contained area of your project. These allows to develop features, fix bugs and to experiment in the project without affecting the other changes of the master branch (master branch would be the default, sometimes it is called main). \n",
    "\n",
    "**`git add file_name`**\n",
    "\n",
    "After your work has been tested and completed, add your changes to the staging area. This means that your files are tracked by Git, changes are complete, so they are ready to be added back to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`git status`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This command confirm that your files were added to the staging area. If the name of the file is listed in green you're good to go. If not, try adding again. In general, it can always be used to show the current state of your local repository, with all modified files listed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`git commit -m \"valuable_but_short_message_here\"`**\n",
    "\n",
    "A commit is a way of saving changes. With this action you tell Git which changes were made and you can add a brief but specific comment about it so your team knows what was done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**`git push branch_name`**\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything was ok, then you can push your changes to the repository, i.e., transfer your work to GitHub. If you accidentally push up to the master you run the risk of overwriting code the master branch which lives within GitHub, unless you are working there without other branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pull request**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if your uploaded work is good to go on the main branch, you'll need to create a pull request through GitHub. A pull request will notify the owner of the repository that you are ready to **merge** your code with the master (or main) branch. The owner can review your code before doing the merge. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**`git pull origin master`**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the master branch was updated from a pull request you will need to again pull down all the changes from the repository. This will ensure that you are working on the most up to date files moving forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Working on a new GitHub project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's do some practice now:**\n",
    "<div class = \"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> Create a directory on your file system: <em>mkdir myproject</em></li>\n",
    "<li> Navigate to the directory: <em>cd myproject</em></li>\n",
    "<li> Initialize git file tracking: <em>git init</em> (this simply creates a new Git repository)</li>\n",
    "<li> Create new files/directories in your working directory</li>\n",
    "<li> Add and commit these changes</li>\n",
    "<li> Create a repository (public/private) on github at <a href='https://github.com/new'>https://github.com/new.</a> </li>\n",
    "<li> Connect your local directory to your empty repository on Github (<em>git push</em>)</li>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Problems When Pulling or Pushing\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working with more people it is common to face the â€œmerge conflicts\" while pushing commits or pulling down.\n",
    "This happens when a file was modified by more than one person, and Git is not able to decide which version should be kept so it will ask you to solve the conflict. Your options would be:\n",
    "  * Keep your local version of the file\n",
    "  * Keep the remote version of the file\n",
    "  * Manually resolve merge conflicts by editing the conflicts marked by <<< >>>\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Summary    \n",
    "\n",
    "* You already know what a **version control** is.\n",
    "* You know the difference between **Git** and **GitHub**.\n",
    "* You understand the **basic workflow** with a version control system.\n",
    "* You know how to work on **existing** GitHub projects.\n",
    "* You can **create** your own GitHub project.\n",
