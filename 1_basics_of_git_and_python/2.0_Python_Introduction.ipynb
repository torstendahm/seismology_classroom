    "Python is a modern high-level programming language. It is a general-purpose and object-oriented language. The main advantages of Python are that it is clean, simple, easy to read and it minimizes the time to develop, debug and mantain the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start we will check how to execute a Python program and we will take a look on the terminology used within Python. When you create your own code this becomes very important as you understand the structure and properties associated to each term. \n",

    "All the files shown in this course are IPython notebooks (ending in **.ipynb**). IPython is an interactive shell included in Python, but it can do more than the standard prompt. IPython adds extra functionalities, as mixing formatted text with Python code and code output. But besides the extra functionalities, you do not need to modify your Python code to run it within an IPython shell. Here we are using Jupyter Notebook, and each ell can either contain text or code. If the cell is a Code cell, then you can run the program in the cell and see inmediately its result.\n",
